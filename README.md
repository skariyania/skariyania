### Sahil Kariyania

👋 Hello, I'm Sahil Kariyania!

I am a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast, exploring the realms using Rust and Python. Currently, I'm diving deep into the Rust programming language, implementing daily examples to solidify my understanding. Simultaneously, I'm also honing my Python skills through hands-on examples, particularly focusing on data structures and design concepts.

## Repositories

- [rust-conceptual](https://github.com/skariyania/rust-conceptual): Daily examples and implementations exploring Rust programming concepts.
- [py-conceptual](https://github.com/skariyania/py-conceptual): Python-centric repository focusing on data structures and design concepts.

## About Me

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer from [Gujarat Technological University](https://gtu.ac.in/) (a State University in [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)). With a decade of dedicated experience in Enterprise Software Engineering, I bring a wealth of knowledge to the table. My enthusiasm for programming extends far beyond repositories, and I am keen to contribute to impactful open-source projects while fostering collaboration with fellow developers.

I have made significant contributions in renowned organizations, including [Accenture Applied Intelligence](https://www.accenture.com/in-en/services/ai-artificial-intelligence-index) — a global technology giant. I've also played a pivotal role in shaping the technology landscape at a Seed Startup - [Kogentix AI](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2018/accenture-acquires-kogentix-to-help-clients-run-legacy-analytics-applications-on-open-source-technologies-to-get-ahead-of-data-surge) and Series A startup - [BIK AI](https://bik.ai/), bringing innovation and agility to the forefront.
